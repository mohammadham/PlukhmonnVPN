# Goal:
 * Create a subscription manager with Free V2ray Configs and V2board Plans => well Done !
 * Generate a new Version of ios/android => on Android testing
 * Add support V2board  management => is working properly
 * Add support admob ads for Free V2ray Configs => Done !
 * Add ability to like and dislike the Free V2ray Configs => im working on it !
 * Add ability for another VPN Supporter can share V2board Plans in one app with own logo and payment gateway address  => just in theory :) 
# Recommend 4 open source alternatives, very powerful and perfect
